Spam Email Prediction or classifier using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing

Dataset used: Small and simple mail data CSV dataset

Developed the spam emails classifier using linear regression models with an achieved accuracy of 96.7%, including techniques like TF- IDF vectorization, Exploratory Data Analysis such as analyzing the distribution of spam and ham messages, word clouds, and frequency analysis, and evaluated the model using precision, recall, F1-score, and testing predictive system for real- time-email-classification.
